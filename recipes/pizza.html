    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p>Making a homemade pizza involves a series of straightforward steps that result in a delicious, customizable dish. Begin by preparing the dough: activate yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar, then mix in flour, salt, and olive oil. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, allowing it to rise until it doubles in size.</p> 
    <p>Once the dough is ready, roll it out to your desired thickness and spread a layer of tomato sauce over it. Add a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese and your choice of toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, or olives. Bake the pizza in a hot oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil for an extra touch of flavor. This process creates a perfect blend of crispy crust, melted cheese, and savory toppings, making for an enjoyable homemade meal.</p>
