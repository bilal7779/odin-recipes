    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of tender pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The process begins with a hearty meat sauce made by sautéing onions and garlic, then browning ground beef and simmering it with tomatoes and Italian herbs.</p><p>Meanwhile, a smooth béchamel sauce is prepared by creating a roux with butter and flour, then adding milk and seasoning it with nutmeg. The lasagna is assembled by layering the meat sauce, pasta sheets, béchamel, and cheese in a baking dish, repeating the layers, and finishing with a generous cheese topping. Baked until golden and bubbly, the lasagna is then rested to set before serving, offering a comforting and flavorful dish perfect for any occasion.</p>
